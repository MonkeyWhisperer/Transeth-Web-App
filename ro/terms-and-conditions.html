</div>


<div>

    The TRANSETH online platform offers its users (organizations, organizational groups, representatives and designated experts), through the management tools provided, an overview of the stage and implementation of the project (s) undergoing the licensing process, representing a means of information and communication, a useful collaboration environment of the project teams in carrying out the activities planned and carried out through the project, an efficient means of internal evaluation of the way and pace of project implementation. The platform creates, through the contribution of its users, a repository of information and deliverables, a system for archiving specific data, which can be accessed only by designated users under security controlled conditions.

        3. Licensing conditions
    </b>
</div>


<div>

    The beneficiaries of the use license are legal entities and can be governmental or non-governmental organizations, patrimonial or non-patrimonial, of public or private law. The licensing system of the platform aims at accessing and using its resources under three factors:

    <ul>
        <li>the number of organizations included in the license;</li>

        <li>the maximum number of projects that will be managed under the license;</li>

        <li>the total number of unique users associated with the license.</li>
    </ul>
    In this context, the combination of the three factors (organizations, projects, users) defines the type of license purchased by the purchaser and is subject to the commercial policies of transeth.org. The licensing process aims to obtain access and the right to use the platform, consisting in the non-exclusive assignment of the right to use the associated software application and access it through the beneficiary's terminals, with specified browser versions: MS Edge 44.0 (or later), Firefox 2.0 (or later) and Chrome 20.0 (or later).
</div>

<br />
<div>
    The maximum number of concurrent users (simultaneously connected to the application) is defined at the beginning of the licensing process regardless of the number of organizations participating in the licensing process. Depending on the subsequent development needs, the number of users can be changed by upgrading to the existing license.

</div>
<br />
<div>
    The licensee has the obligation to provide the data necessary to initialize the platform: users, user roles (expert, partner representative, project manager, etc.), projects, etc. The level of access of the users, to the resources of the platform is managed by the beneficiary / beneficiaries of the license and is communicated in writing to the administrator of the platform at the address contact@transeth.org. After the creation of the accounts and the associated roles, the beneficiary / beneficiaries of the license have the obligation to verify them, the eventual dysfunctions being sent to the same address. The details of the access mechanism are presented in the section Access conditions.
</div>

<div>
    The data uploaded by users in the online platform TRANSETH, emulates in the virtual environment the projects carried out by the licensee and, as the case may be, his partners. In this context, the quality and relevance of the uploaded data affect the quality and relevance of the information exported through the predefined reports. The data are exported under conditions controlled by the licensee / beneficiaries, based on the mechanism for granting users access to the platform's resources. After exporting from the platform and downloading to users' own terminals, data, predefined reports and archives of technical documents, the use and management of sensitive information belongs to the licensee and its partners. Modifications to the reports exported by the beneficiaries are defined according to the instructions issued by the program management authority (MA) and cannot be modified by the licensee.
